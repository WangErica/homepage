              <center><h5>About Silverstein Family Park</h5></center>
              <p>The Silverstein Family Park is a triangular park, in front of 7 World Trade Center, that consists of a central open space and a fountain.
              It featured a Jeff Koons's "Balloon Flower" sculpture.
              This park was named after Larry Silverstein, an American businessman.
              After 9/11, he retained the rights to build 2, 3 and 4 World Trade Center.</p>

              <center><h5>About the Oculus</h5></center>
              <p>In 2016, the Oculus was opened for the public. It is widely known as the World Trade Center transportation hub.
              It was designed by Spanish architect and structure engineer Santiago Calatrava, using a glass and steel structure.
              The Oculus resembles “a bird flying from the hands of a child,” bringing a sense of hope to a site of tragedy (9/11).</p>

              <center><h5>About Brookfield Place</h5></center>
              <p>Brookfield Place, designed by Cesar Place, was built on the landfill used to build Battery Park City.
              It is also known as the World Financial Center, but it is a shopping center.
              After 9/11, it went under a $250 million renovation, connecting it to the Oculus and the World Trade Center.
              Most stores in this place are expensive, including Hermes, Burberry and Gucci.</p>

              <center><h5>About 9/11 Memorial</h5></center>
              <p>The 9/11 Memorial was built to honor those who were killed in 2001 and 1993.
              In 1993, there was a World Trade Center bombing that killed 6 people.
              In 2001, about 2,977 people died in the terror attack.
              On the side is a 9/11 Memorial Museum, that contains a collection of monumental artifacts and presents visitors with their stories of loss and hope.

          <center><h3>One World Trade Center</h3></center>
          <p>One World Trade Centeris the 7th tallest building in the world and one of the tallest building in the United States.
          The building's architect is David Childs, whose company also designed the Willis Tower and the Burj Khalifa.
          The building is 104 standard floors high, but the tower has only 94 actual stories.
          It is also 1776 feet high, the year the Declaration of Independence was signed.
          Its official legal name is One World Trade Center and not the Freedom Tower.
          The estimated cost of construction is around $3.9 billion.
          There are about or more than 50 companies in the World Trade Center.
          The “One World Observatory", opened in 2015, is an enclosed observation deck that rises 1,250 feet above street level. </p>
